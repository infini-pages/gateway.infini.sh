âœ— ./bin/gateway --help Usage of ./bin/gateway: -config string the location of config file, default: gateway.yml (default &amp;quot;gateway.yml&amp;quot;) -cpu int the number of CPUs to use (default -1) -cpuprofile string write cpu profile to this file -daemon run in background as daemon -debug run in debug mode, gateway will quit with panic error -log string the log level,options:trace,debug,info,warn,error (default &amp;quot;info&amp;quot;) -memprofile string write memory profile to this file -pidfile string pidfile path (only for daemon mode) -pprof string enable and setup pprof/expvar service, eg: localhost:6060 , the endpoint will be: http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/ and http://localhost:6060/debug/vars -v version The parameters are described as follows:</description></item><item><title>Container Deployment</title><link>/docs/getting-started/docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/getting-started/docker/</guid><description>Container Deployment # INFINI Gateway supports container deployment.
Installation Demo # Downloading an Image # The images of INFINI Gateway are published at the official repository of Docker. The URL is as follows:
https://hub.docker.com/r/infinilabs/gateway
Use the following command to obtain the latest container image:
docker pull infinilabs/gateway:latest Verifying the Image # After downloading the image locally, you will notice that the container image of INFINI Gateway is very small, with a size less than 25 MB.</description></item><item><title>System Optimization</title><link>/docs/getting-started/optimization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/getting-started/optimization/</guid><description>System Optimization # The operating system of the server where INFINI Gateway is installed needs to be optimized to ensure that INFINI Gateway runs in the best possible state. The following uses Linux as an example.

Highlights of Loadgen:
Robust performance Lightweight and dependency-free Random selection of template-based parameters High concurrency Balanced traffic control at the benchmark end Download URL: http://release.infinilabs.com/loadgen/
Loadgen # Loadgen is easy to use. After the tool is downloaded and decompressed, two files are obtained: one executable program and one configuration file loadgen.</description></item></channel></rss>
